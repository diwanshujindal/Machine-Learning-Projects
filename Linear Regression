Steps of the Data Analysis Process
1. Import Libraries
Load necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
2. Mount Google Drive
Establish a connection to Google Drive to access the dataset.
3. Load Data into DataFrame
Import the dataset into a DataFrame for easy data manipulation.
4. Data Exploration
View Data: Check the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset.
Check Data Types and Null Values: Verify the data types of each column and check for any missing values.
Basic Statistics: Generate summary statistics for the numerical columns to understand their distributions.
5. Visual Data Exploration
Joint Plots: Create visualizations to explore relationships between features and the target variable.
Pair Plots: Use pair plots to visualize the interactions among all numeric features.
6. Feature Selection
Identify which features (input variables) will be used to predict the target variable (output).
7. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
Divide the dataset into a training set (for building the model) and a testing set (for evaluating model performance), typically using a 75-25% split.
8. Train the Linear Regression Model
Use the training data to fit a linear regression model that learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
9. Evaluate Model Coefficients
Review the coefficients produced by the model to understand the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable.
10. Make Predictions
Use the trained model to generate predictions on the testing set.
11. Visualize Predictions
Create scatter plots to compare the actual target values with the predicted values to assess the model's accuracy visually.
12. Calculate Error Metrics
Compute various error metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error, to quantify the model's performance.
13. Analyze Residuals
Examine the distribution of the residuals (the differences between actual and predicted values) to assess model fit.
Create a Q-Q plot to evaluate the normality of the residuals.
Summary
This structured approach guides you through understanding the dataset, building a predictive model, and evaluating its effectiveness, all while emphasizing clear documentation and visual insights. If you have any specific questions or need further details on a particular step, feel free to ask!
